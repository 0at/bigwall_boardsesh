# ESPHOME Aurora Bluetooth Proxy

I had a go at getting chatgpt and claude to build me a ESPHOME kilter bluetooth proxy, so
I could connect through that and get some extra entities for my board in home assistant.
It wasnt very successful, and Im not sure if it was due to the ESP32 displays I was trying to use
or something else. So I'm just leaving this here in a broken state, hoping 1 day I'll feel motivated
to bash my head into a brick wall for 3 hours trying to get esphome to work
